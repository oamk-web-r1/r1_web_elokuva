# Movie Web Appllication
This was a second-year group project with the goal of developing a movie web application. The application allows users to browse and search for movies, view and filter showtimes, read and leave reviews, add movies to a favorites list, and share them within a group of like-minded individuals.

The movie data and some reviews were fetched from The Movie Database API, while showtime information came from Finnkino’s open API. The movies and showtimes are not connected in the application.

# Tools and Languages
The project was built using React and JavaScript for the frontend, with JavaScript also powering the backend. PostgreSQL was used for the database, and CSS for the UI. The database, backend, and frontend were all hosted on Render. Unfortunately, the database is currently offline due to hosting costs, which means the application is temporarily non-functional as we search for a new host for it.
